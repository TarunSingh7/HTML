                <p>
                    Sidhu started listening to hip-hop music in sixth grade and learned music skills from Harvinder Bittu in Ludhiana.
        He started his career by writing the lyrics of the song ”License” sung by Ninja, and began his singing career on a duet song titled ”G Wagon”.
        After that, he collaborated with Brown Boys for various tracks which were released by Humble Music and gained wide attention with his track ”So High”.
        In 2018, he released his debut album ”PBX 1”, which peaked at 66th on the Billboard Canadian Albums chart.
        Sidhu actively campaigned for his mother, Charan Kaur, who won the sarpanch election from Moosa village in December 2018.
        Moose Wala has a rivalry with Karan Aujla, both have been replying to each other through their songs, social media handles, and live performances.
        His single “47” was ranked on UK Singles Chart, the song featured British rappers Mist and Stefflon Don and later Sidhu was named by The Guardian among the 50 new artists in 2020.
        On 4 May 2020, Moose Wala’s two videos went viral in which he was training to use AK-47 with police officers, later police officials were suspended and the case was booked under two sections of the arms act.
        In December 2020 Sidhu released a single ”Panjab” as a protest against farm laws but lyrics glorifying militant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his call to pick up arms against the Indian State.
        He has his fair share of controversies, often getting into legal troubles by promoting gun culture and also using inflammatory and inciting lyrics in his songs.
        On 15 May 2021, he releases his third album ”Moosetape” featuring artists like Sikander Kahlon, Raja Kumari, Divine, Bohemia, Tion Wayne, Stefflon Don, Morrison, and Blockboi Twitch.
        Moose Wala was shot dead in his car on 29 May 2022 in Jawaharke village of Mansa district, by unidentified assailants.
